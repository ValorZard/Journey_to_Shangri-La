And each time, he could not decipher anything new.\nMost of the words had been burnt away, but some fragments, much like the drawing of the fan, had remained.\nThere must be more.\nHe had seen the power the fan held. He had seen the potential. And he would have it. For Japan. For a better future.\nNow, Hiroshi sits in an empty restaurant, waiting for food… and news."
