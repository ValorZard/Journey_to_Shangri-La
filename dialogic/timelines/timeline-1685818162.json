The street you found yourself on was wide enough to fit three cars, and yet with the number of people packed around you, you could barely glimpse the other side. \nAlmost as overwhelming as the number of people were the numerous colorful store signs stretching into the sky above your heads, fighting for attention. Even if you could read Japanese, it would probably take you forever to figure out where to go. "
