			"text": "DATE: APRIL 1937\nLOCATION: TRAIN TO SIKKIM\nThe Professor and Raj are taking Soot on a walk around the train. From your seat, you see how excited the cat is in Raj’s hands, looking at all the new people and sights.\nYou are alone with Mateo in your seats, the windows a blur as the train moves along its tracks.\nMateo twiddles with the strings on his guitar, eyes down. He hasn’t been like himself lately. Usually, he would explore the train with the others, press his face against the window and stare out at the passing scenery, hum a tune, or tell you about his colorful, exciting, and almost fantastical stories.\nHe’s quiet and reserved now, hyper-focused on his guitar. Especially after all that action on the train, you would expect him to be super chatty about the experience."
